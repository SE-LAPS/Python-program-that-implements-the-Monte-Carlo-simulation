To find the probability that, in a family with three children, all are girls if at least one of them is a girl, we can use the following steps:

Assume that the probability of a child being a girl is 1/2, and that the genders of the children are independent of each other. This means that the probability of any combination of genders is equal to the product of the probabilities of each child being a boy or a girl.

Calculate the probability that at least one of the children is a girl. This can be done by summing the probabilities of the different combinations of genders that include at least one girl:

The probability of having one girl and two boys is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8
The probability of having two girls and one boy is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8
The probability of having three girls is (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/8
The total probability of at least one girl is 1/8 + 1/8 + 1/8 = 3/8 = 0.375

Calculate the probability that all three children are girls given that at least one of them is a girl. This can be done using the formula for conditional probability: P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B). In this case, A is the event "all children are girls" and B is the event "at least one child is a girl".
The probability of A and B occurring is 1/8, since there is only one combination of genders that satisfies both events (three girls). The probability of B occurring is 3/8, as calculated in step 2.

Therefore, the probability of A given B is P(A|B) = 1/8 / 3/8 = 1/3 = 0.333

To programmatically prove this probability using a Monte Carlo simulation in Python, we can use the following steps:

Define a function that simulates the genders of the children. The function should take the number of simulations as an argument and return a list of booleans representing the genders of the children, with True representing a girl and False representing a boy.

Inside the function, use a loop to simulate the genders of the children for the given number of times. For each simulation, use a random number generator to determine the genders of the children with a probability of 1/2 for each child being a girl.

Use a separate loop to count the number of simulations in which at least one child is a girl and all children are girls.

Return the ratio of the two counts as the probability of all children being girls given that at least one of them is a girl.

def simulate_genders(num_simulations):
at_least_one_girl = 0
all_girls = 0    

for i in range(num_simulations):
    girls = 0
    for j in range(3):
        if random.random() < 0.5:
            girls += 1
    if girls >= 1:
        at_least_one_girl += 1
        if girls == 3:
            all_girls += 1

return all_girls / at_least_one_girl

num_simulations = 1000
probability = simulate_genders(num_simulations)
print("Probability of all children being girls given at least one girl: {:.3f}".format(probability))

This program will run the Monte Carlo simulation for 1000 times and print the probability of all children being girls given that at least one of them is a girl.
